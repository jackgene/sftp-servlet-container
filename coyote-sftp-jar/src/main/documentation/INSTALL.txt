Quick Installation Instructions
===============================
Pre-requisites:
1.  A working installation of Apache Tomcat 7.0.x.


Installing:
After unzipping the distribution zip file:
1. Copy all the files from /copy-to-tomcat-lib into Tomcat's lib
   (e.g., ${CATALINA_HOME}/lib) directory.

2. Add the following XML element inside the <Service> element of the
   conf/server.xml file:
   
       <Connector port="2222" protocol="my.edu.clhs.tomcat.coyote.SftpProtocol"
               anonymousUsername="anonymous" sessionTimeout="600000" />
   
   (You may wish to use a different port number or sessionTimeout value)

3. Start Tomcat as you usually would.


Verifying the installation:
1. You should see the following line towards the end of the console output
   (or in your catalina.out file):
   
   Jul 15, 2012 11:28:00 AM my.edu.clhs.tomcat.coyote.SftpProtocol start
   INFO: Starting ProtocolHandler ["sftp-2222"]

2. Try connecting to the server as user "anonymous" with an SFTP client, you
   should see the following or equivalent for your client (this assumes you
   have the default Tomcat ROOT webapp deployed):
   
   $ sftp -oPort=2222 anonymous@localhost
   anonymous@localhost's password: (any password)
   Connected to localhost.
   sftp> ls
   remote readdir("/"): Unknown status
   sftp> get / index.html
   Fetching / to index.html
   /                                             100% 7779     7.6KB/s   00:00
