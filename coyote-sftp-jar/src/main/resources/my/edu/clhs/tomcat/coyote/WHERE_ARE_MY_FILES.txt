This is a filesystem view of a Java EE web application.

It behaves in two different ways, depending on if the deployed web application
supports the HTTP WebDAV extensions.

If the web application does not support WebDAV extensions (this is typical):
  - Files paths are mapped to Servlet resource URIs.
  
  - File operations are translated to Servlet requests in the following manner:
      SFTP command            Servlet request method
      get                     GET
      put                     PUT
      rm                      DELETE
      rmdir                   DELETE
    (Commands are based on the OpenSSH SFTP client)
  
  - You can navigate into any directory using the "cd" command , even if they
    do not exist, or are inaccessible. E.g., "cd /WEB-INF" succeeds even though
    you won't be able to access anything under WEB-INF.
  
  - All directories appear to be empty except for this
    THIS_IS_NOT_A_FILESYSTEM.txt file.
    E.g.,
    If you list the files under root, you only see this file listed even
    though "/index.jsp" may in fact be a valid Servlet resource:
     sftp> ls /
     README.txt   
     sftp> get /index.jsp
     Fetching /index.jsp to index.jsp
     /index.jsp                                   100%  7779    7.6KB/s   00:00
  
  - You can access resources in a directory using the full path, or by
    navigating into the directory using "cd" first.
    E.g.,
    To access "/foo/bar.gif" you can:
     sftp> get /foo/bar.gif
    or:
     sftp> cd /foo
     sftp> get bar.gif
  
  - If a path maps to a Servlet resource that is both a file and a directory
    (this is possible in web applications), you must append a slash (/) to it
    to navigate to it as a directory. You may access it as a file using the path
    directly or by appending a slash dot (/.) to it.
    E.g.,
    If /baz is both a file and a directory, this is how you would access its
    file contents:
     sftp> get /baz
    or:
     sftp> get /baz/.
   
    and this is how you would list its directory contents:
     sftp> cd /baz/
    
    One special case is the root directory, if it's both a file and directory,
    this is how you would access its file contents:
      sftp> get /.
    
    and this is how you would list its directory contents:
     sftp> cd /
  
  - The following commands are not supported:
      chgrp
      chmod
      chown
      ln
      mkdir
      rename

If the web application does support WebDAV extensions (this is rare), you will
be able to access it more or less like a regular filesystem. Specifically in
addition to the capabilities above:
  - You will be able to list the contents of directories using ls.
    (this is translated into a WebDAV PROPFIND operation with Depth: 1).
  
  - You will be able to create directories using mkdir.
    (this is translated into a WebDAV MKCOL operation).
  
  - However, you will NOT be able to navigate into arbitrary directories using
    "cd" (there is no need to).
  
  - The following commands are not supported:
      chgrp
      chmod
      chown
      ln
      rename
